"""Reservation notifications.

A small pluggable mechanism: each reservation event (created / updated / cancelled)
is delivered to the owner over any channel they have contact info for. Email uses
SMTP and SMS uses the Twilio REST API, both configured via environment variables
(see ``create_app``). When a channel isn't configured, the message is logged and an
audit row is still recorded, so the mechanism is fully exercisable without secrets.

Every attempt is written to the ``notification`` table with a status:

- ``sent``     delivered through a configured provider
- ``failed``   provider configured but raised an error (details captured)
- ``logged``   provider not configured; message written to the app log
- ``skipped``  the owner has no contact info for any channel

Dispatch never raises into the request flow — a notification problem must not
prevent a booking from succeeding.
